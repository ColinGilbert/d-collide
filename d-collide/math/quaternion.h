    /*!
     * A rotation can be represented in several ways, a quaternion is one of them.
     *
     * The by far easiest and most popular way is to store 3 different rotation
     * values, one for each axis. In OpenGL code this will look like this:
     * <pre>
     * glRotatef(angleX, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
     * glRotatef(angleY, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
     * glRotatef(angleZ, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
     * </pre>
     * These angles are called euler angles.
     * They suffer from the so-called * "gimbal-lock".
     *
     * Use google to find a description on what this "gimbal lock" is  - i am not
     * qualified enough to give a correct description. It is enough to say that the
     * rotation will not occur as you want it to.
     *
     * Another representation is the angle axis representation. Here you do only one
     * rotation, by an arbitrary axis. Code:
     * <pre>
     * glRotatef(angle, axisX, axisY, axisZ);
     * </pre>
     * This does not suffer from gimbal lock but (according to some
     * tutorials/howtos) it suffers from other things, such as when you interpolate
     * between two rotations. This problem does not matter for us, as we do not
     * (yet?) use it. But it is imho hard to use and to calculate.
     *
     * The third, and probably most popular among big 3d projects, way of
     * representing rotations are quaternions.
     *
     * I will not try to explain to you what exactly quaternions are - i am not
     * qualified enough to do this. Use google and e.g.
     * http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1095.asp
     *
     * A quaternion consists of 4 floating point values - a scalar (w) and a vector
     * (v).
     * You can get a rotation matrix (see \ref matrix) from a quaternion and
     * therefore you can easily use it in glMultMatrix.
     *
     * You can convert all major means of rotation into a quaternion,
     * see \ref setRotation.
     *
     * If you \ref multiply a quat by another one you get a similar effect as
     * if you had multiplied both rotation matrices, i.e. the two rotations are
     * combined.
