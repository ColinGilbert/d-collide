     * \brief Bounding Volume hierarchy for deformable objects
     *
     * This algorithm builds up a simple (usually \ref Aabb based) \ref
     * BoundingVolume hierarchy for deformable objects. The hierarchy in a
     * hybrid top-down \em and bottom-up approach, see the paper "Collision
     * Detection for Continuously Deforming Bodies" (Larsson, Akenine-MÃ¶ller)
     * which has essentially been implemented here.
     *
     * The main idea is as follows:
     * \li Initially a \ref Aabb hierarchy is constructed. This hierarchy remain
     *     unchanged for the whole simulation, only the size of the \ref Aabbs
     *     are adjusted.
     * \li Whenever the proxy/mesh deforms, the top \ref BvHierarchyBvhNode node
     *     is adjusted to the new loo of the \ref Mesh. (i.e. top-down approach,
     *     the \ref BoundingVolume objects deeper in the hierarchy are \em not
     *     yet touched at this point)
     * \li When a collision with the top node is detected, the children of the
     *     top-node are adjusted, too (top-down again).
     * \li When a certain depth has been reached in the hierarchy, the remaining
     *     nodes are updated bottom-up.
     *
     * The idea is rather simple: if you don't have any collisions, a top-down
     * update of nodes very high in the hierarchy is very fast. If you may have
     * a collision (i.e. collision detection reached a certain point in the
     * hierarchy), then a bottom-up appraoch becomes faster.
