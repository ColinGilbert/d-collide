     * \brief The spatial hash algorithm detects collisions and selfcollisions of freely deformable proxies.
     * This algorithm is basically an implementation of the method decribed in "Optimized Spatial 
     * Hashing for Collision Detection of Deformable Objects". You may find this paper on B. Heidelbergers
     * personal homepage: \link http://www.beosil.com/publications.html
     *
     * This method uses a hashing algorithm to speed up the search for intersecting triangles in and between
     * objects. The algorithm is split into two phases, as described in the paper. The first phase, in the
     * following referenced as "phase one" is the update phase of the algorithm. All vertices which have
     * changed their position are classified against the dictionary. As phase one is rather performant
     * and to allow for generic deformations, we classify every vertice of all participating proxies, 
     * every frame against the hash. So every vertex may be transformed per frame, without any constraints.
     *
     * In phase two, the actual collision detection takes places. As described in the paper we donÂ´t do
     * edge-edge collision detection. As a consequence the collision of rather large triangles may be
     * missed. Edge-edge collisions are rare especially when we consider the dense meshes used for
     * deformable objects.
     *
     * The division in phase one and two was done for performance reasons. The first implementation of this
     * algorithm classified triangles only. This turned out to be inefficent, because the bounding boxes
     * of adjacent triangles overlap a lot. A better solution is to only add the vertices and afterwards determine the
     * set of triangles starting at this vertice.
     * Multithreading:
     *
     * \li Phase 1, the update phase is not multithreaded.
     * \li Phase 2, the collision detection phase is multithreaded, the user may control the number of
     * triangles per job, via the define SPATIALHASH_TRIANGLES_PER_THREAD.
     * Class Overview:
     *
     * The \ref dcollide::SpatialHashAlgorithm implements DetectorDeform interface, and is therefore
     * responsible for job creation and interfacing with the \ref dcollide::pipeline
     * The  \ref dcollide::SpatialGrid class represents a three dimensional uniform subdivision of space
     * using a datastructure of type \ref dcollide::SpatialHash.
