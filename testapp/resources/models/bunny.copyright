Inappropriate uses of these models
 As you browse this repository and think about how you might use our 3D models
 and range datasets, please remember that several of these artifacts have
 religious or cultural significance. Aside from the buddha, which is a
 religious symbol revered by hundreds of millions of people, the dragon is a
 symbol of Chinese culture, the Thai statue contains elements of religious
 significance to Hindus, and Lucy is a Christian angel; statues like her are
 commonly seen in Italian churches. Keep your renderings and other uses of
 these particular models in good taste. Don't animate or morph them, don't
 apply Boolean operators to them, and don't simulate nasty things happening to
 them (like breaking, exploding, melting, etc.). Choose another model for
 these sorts of experiments. (You can do anything you want to the Stanford
 bunny or the armadillo.)
