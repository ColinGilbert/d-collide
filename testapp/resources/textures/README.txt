Textures for the d-collide testapp.

Please only add files to svn that
a) you have the copyright of (or have permission from the one who does) to 100%
b) you license under the BSD license (since d-collide is meant to be under
   BSD).
   keep in mind that this allows commercial of these textures use by everyone.



NOTE: if you used some texture from the internet and heavily modified it, you
      do NOT own the copyright!
      -> you can not put a license on it without permission from the original
         designer!



textures that do not meet these requirements can currently be found in the
d-collide wiki (which can be accessed by the d-collide developers only!)
some of these textures may be free (e.g. GPL), but not BSD, some may not even be
free.
